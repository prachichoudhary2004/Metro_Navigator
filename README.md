â€¢	Metro Navigator- Developed a Java-based Metro Rail App using Graph and Heap data structures. The app incorporates algorithms like Dijkstra, BFS, and DFS to determine the optimal path, while also considering station details like name, corridor, and connecting lines. It provides commuters with a detailed metro route, fare calculation, and an interactive metro map for seamless navigation. The solution efficiently handles user inputs and outputs key travel information.
