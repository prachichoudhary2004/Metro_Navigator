 🚇 Metro Navigator – Java-Based Metro Route Planner

Metro Navigator is a Java-based console application designed to help commuters find optimal routes in a metro rail network. The application leverages advanced graph algorithms and data structures to calculate the shortest and most efficient path between two stations. It considers corridor changes, connection points, and travel fares — making urban commuting smarter and easier.

 ✨ Features

📍 Optimal Pathfinding
Uses Dijkstra’s algorithm for shortest path calculation and supports BFS and DFS for route exploration and network traversal.

🧠 Intelligent Navigation
Provides detailed route instructions including intermediary stations, required line changes, and terminal stations.

💰 Fare Calculation
Automatically calculates estimated fare based on travel distance or number of stops using a customizable pricing model.

🗺️ Interactive Metro Map Representation
Simulates a logical map structure of metro corridors and connections for internal routing and output visualization.

🔎 Station Details Lookup
Displays relevant information about metro stations such as name, corridor, interchange stations, and connected lines.
